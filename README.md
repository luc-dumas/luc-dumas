## About

I was drawn to software development after realizing how much of a **craft** it can be.  
Craftsmanship has always been a passion of mine:

- Grew up in my father‚Äôs French kitchen.  
- Worked on an apple/peach orchard for 3 years, surrounded by craftspeople.  
- Carpentry, cabinetry, furniture making, campervan building, timber framing, and software.  

Craftsmanship is dedication, curiosity, teamwork, and perseverance ‚Äî creating something with intention and integrity. Implementing a new feature or architecting a codebase is a lot like designing a kitchen or timber frame: you break a large complex problem into smaller, manageable parts.
